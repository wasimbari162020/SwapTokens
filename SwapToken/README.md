# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```


# Project statement:
For a given amount of token to be swapped, the percentage of token value to be swapped with differen tokens, is determined by values stored in mapping 'tokenBucket'. For a instance, to swap 100 USDC tokens, among DAI, WETH and LINK if the percentage to be swapped with DAI, WETH and LINK are 20, 40,40 respectively, then 20 USDC tokens will be swapped with DAI, 40 USDC tokens with WETH and 40 USDC tokens will be swapped with LINK tokens.

# This project uses uniswap v3 to swap tokens. It contains 3 files :
 SwapUDSC.sol : To swap USDC tokens with DAI, WETH and LINL[chainlink token]
 SwapUSDT.sol : To swap USDT tokens with DAI, WETH, WBTC and LINL[chainlink token]
 SwapCustomERC20.sol : to swap custom  ERC20 token with DAI, WETH and USDC. 

# Uses Hardhat's 'deployProxy' to deploy the contract in order to upgrade it later. For the reference, I have created a 'SwapUSDCTokenv2.sol' and upgraded the 'SwapUSDCToken.sol' . Please refer 'upgradeusdc.js' under 'scripts' folder. In the same way, the other contracts can be upgraded too.

# Multiple swaps in one transaction : To incorporate this, the 'swap' method present in all smart contracts bundles the multiple swap transactions and triggers as a single transaction. Transaction triggered to swap USDC : https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0x124faac5642d683301bb95ce70abbdf8eea31051f83c5e7238ae6f1c8ce858f2

# Deploy and upgrade contract 
Create an .env file at the root level. You can refer '.env.reference' get an idea of .env contents. 
.env has 2 variables :MNEMONIC , which is a wallet backup phrase.And INFURA_PROJECT_ID is the project of the infura.

# Commands to run to deploy contracts : 
npx hardhat run --network goerli scripts/deployswapusdc.js
npx hardhat run --network goerli scripts/deployswapusdc.js
npx hardhat run --network goerli scripts/deployswapcustomerc20.js

# Upgrade contract :
Suppose, we have deployed SwapUSDC contract :
wasim@wasims-MacBook-Pro SwapToken % npx hardhat run --network goerli scripts/deployswapusdc.js
Deploying
deployed SwapUSDC  0xbcD0Ad5476a46704EDB6aE69733E61bB0FCEAde9

And now, you want to upgrade it to the 'SwapUSDCTokenv2', then pass the proxy address[0xbcD0Ad5476a46704EDB6aE69733E61bB0FCEAde9] you got post deployment of SwapUSDC as 'PROXY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS' value in 'upgradeusdc.js'.

wasim@wasims-MacBook-Pro SwapToken % npx hardhat run --network goerli scripts/upgradeusdc.js   
upgrading to SwapUSDCTokenv2
upgraded SWAPUSDv2  0xbcD0Ad5476a46704EDB6aE69733E61bB0FCEAde9
